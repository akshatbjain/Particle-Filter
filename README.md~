# Particle Filter - Kidnapped Vehicle

Our robot has been kidnapped and transported to a new location! Luckily it has a map of this location, a (noisy) GPS estimate of its initial location, and lots of (noisy) sensor and control data.

This project is an implementation of a 2-dimensional particle filter in C++. The particle filter is given a map and some initial localization information (analogous to what a GPS would provide). At each time step, the filter also gets observation and control data.
